# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI

## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers, Job Transitioners, and Job Swappers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation.

### Dashboard File
You can find the file for the dashboard here: [`Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix`](Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix).  

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
